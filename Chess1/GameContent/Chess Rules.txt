Starting a Game
At the beginning of the game the chessboard is 
laid out so that each player has the white (or light) color square
in the bottom right-hand side. 
The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time. 
The second row (or rank) is filled with pawns. 
The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to them,
followed by the bishops, and finally the queen,
who always goes on her own matching color 
(white queen on white, black queen on black), 
and the king on the remaining square.
The player with the white pieces always moves first.
Therefore, players generally decide who will get to be white by chance
or luck such as flipping a coin or having one player guess the color
of the hidden pawn in the other player's hand. 
White then makes a move, followed by black, then white again, 
then black and so on until the end of the game.

How the Pieces Move
Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently.
Pieces cannot move through other pieces
(though the knight can jump over other pieces), 
and can never move onto a square with one of their own pieces. 
However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece 
which is then captured. 
Pieces are generally moved into positions where they can capture other pieces
(by landing on their square and then replacing them), 
defend their own pieces in case of capture, 
or control important squares in the game.
